# Sorting-Visualizer
I created an interactive GUI that visually demonstrates the step-by-step sorting process. The project allowed users to observe the sorting algorithms in action, 
gaining insights into their efficiency and performance. I also incorporated user controls to start, pause, and reset the sorting process, providing a user-friendly 
experience.
